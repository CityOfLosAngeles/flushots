It's that time of year. I have again partnered with the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) to create a updated flu shot finder web application. Currently it has all the CDPH free locations and events. Soon, it will include Walgreens, CVS, and possibly other locations.

I created this as a volunteer effort, The code that runs it is open, completely free, and reusable by anyone.

NOTES:

-- I used the generic Bootstrap 3 download, except it has one modified LESS variable: '@screen-sm' was set to '860px'.

-- If you want to reuse this code for your city/county/province/state, a good place to start is in main.js and altering the properties of the "Default" object at the top of the file.

-- I try to use meaningful variable names, so hopefully the code won't be too hard to follow.
